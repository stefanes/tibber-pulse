## Installation

> **Note**
>
> To access the API you first must have a Tibber account (you can [sign up for Tibber](https://tibber.com/se/invite/gqpkcwrn) using the invitation code `gqpkcwrn` to get a **â‚¬50/500 kr bonus** for use in the [Tibber Store](https://tibber.com/se/store)).

Before manually running the scripts in found in this repo you need to first install and setup the following PowerShell modules:

* [PSTibber](https://github.com/stefanes/PSTibber)
* [PSGraphite](https://github.com/stefanes/PSGraphite)

See [here](https://github.com/stefanes/PSTibber#authentication) and [here](https://github.com/stefanes/PSGraphite#authentication) for how to setup authentication.

## Usage examples

### Get today's and tomorrow's energy prices

Use [`tibber-price-json.ps1`](tibber-price-json.ps1) to get today's and tomorrow's energy prices and  and [`tibber-price-publish.ps1`](tibber-price-publish.ps1) to publish the data to the following Graphite series:

| Graphite series            | Measurement | Unit        | Resolution |
| -------------------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| `tibber.hourly.price`      | `total`     | SEK         | 1h         |
| `tibber.hourly.priceLevel` | `level`     | _See below_ | 1h         |
| `tibber.hourly.priceScore` | N/A         | _See below_ | 1h         |

The `tibber.hourly.priceLevel` series contains the price levels as defined [here](https://developer.tibber.com/docs/reference#pricelevel), translated into the following values:

| Price level      | Value |
| ---------------- | ----- |
| `VERY_CHEAP`     | 10    |
| `CHEAP`          | 20    |
| `NORMAL`         | 30    |
| `EXPENSIVE`      | 40    |
| `VERY_EXPENSIVE` | 50    |

The `tibber.hourly.priceScore` series contains a custom price score as defined below:

| Price score | Value | Definition                        |
| ----------- | ----- | --------------------------------- |
| `LOW`       | -1    | A price higher than average + 10% |
| `MEDIUM`    | 0     | Average price +/- 10%             |
| `HIGH`      | 1     | A price lower than average - 10%  |

| Graphite series               | Measurement       | Unit | Resolution |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------- | ---- | ---------- |

| `tibber.live.powerProduction` | `powerProduction` | W    | 10s        |
| `tibber.live.voltagePhase1`   | `voltagePhase1`   | V    | 10s        |
| `tibber.live.voltagePhase2`   | `voltagePhase2`   | V    | 10s        |
| `tibber.live.voltagePhase3`   | `voltagePhase3`   | V    | 10s        |

## Graphite `storage-schemas.conf`

Recommended [`storage-schemas.conf`](https://graphite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config-carbon.html#storage-schemas-conf) settings:

```ini
[tibber.daily]
  pattern    = ^tibber\.daily\..*
  retentions = 1d:2y
[tibber.hourly]
  pattern    = ^tibber\.hourly\..*
  retentions = 1h:2y

[tibber.live.signalStrength]
  pattern    = ^tibber\.live\.signalStrength$
  retentions = 2m:8w4d
[tibber.live]
  pattern    = ^tibber\.live\..*
  retentions = 10s:1w1d
```

See [here](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/data-configuration/metrics/metrics-graphite/http-api/#adjust-storage-schemasconf-and-storage-aggregationconf) for how to change the storage schemas using the config API.

## Time zones

Running these scripts on e.g. Azure Pipelines agent will by default log UTC times. To change this behaviour provide a time zone using the `-TimeZone` parameter:

```powershell
PS> .\tibber-price-json.ps1 -Path 'C:\tibber' -TimeZone 'India Standard Time'
Home ID for 'Vitahuset': 96a14971-525a-4420-aae9-e5aedaa129ff
Energy price (India Standard Time):
    0.7542 SEK at 2022-09-23 03:30:00 [level = 10] [score = 1]
    0.7113 SEK at 2022-09-23 04:30:00 [level = 10] [score = 1]
    ...
    1.0319 SEK at 2022-09-24 01:30:00 [level = 10] [score = 1]
    0.8517 SEK at 2022-09-24 02:30:00 [level = 10] [score = 1]
...
```

List all available time zones:

```powershell
Write-Host "Available time zone Ids:"
[TimeZoneInfo]::GetSystemTimeZones() | ForEach-Object {
    Write-Host $_.Id -ForegroundColor White
    Write-Host "Offset: $($_.BaseUtcOffset.ToString())"
}
```

_Note: This will not impact the timestamp sent to Graphite._
